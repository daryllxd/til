I started my first job as a Professional Programmer on April 21, 2014. I would like to think that I have graduated from being a junior developer to being someone intermediate. If I could go back in time and tell myself what I should be doing, here is what I would say:

- Optimize each little thing with your development environment/editor. Go to your editor's plugin page and look at whatever plugin you can find. If you can't find a good plugin for what you want to have, then create one yourself. Whatever editor you use, learn everything about it.
- Optimize your non-development environment (software). This usually means your browser, and operating system. Browser optimizations: extensions like Shut Down Facebook News Feed. Operating system optimizations: Alfred. Some of my optimizations: Spectacle, Caffeine, Dropbox.
- Be good at Where's Waldo. I mean be good at spotting small logic errors. Things like `if file_extension = 'jpg'` versus `if file_extension == 'jpg'` drove me crazy. Stupid stuff like editing the wrong file, not reloading the browser cache so I think what I'm doing is not working...
- Optimize your non-development environment (physical environment). Every little thing should be something that helps you. I like hard chairs better than soft ones so I code on this crappy $15 chair. I don't want to prepare coffee when I wake up so I drink one 3-in-1 coffee when I wake up, and then after that I drink the office coffee.
- Go outside once in a while. There has to be some kind of actual study where exercise boosts brain productivity. Run, swim, lift, shoot some hoops, or do anything. Literally anything physical will work. [I'm personally addicted to the bike.](https://www.strava.com/athletes/10936750) I try to bike 3 times a week. While biking I've come up with a too many ideas to mention. In fact, this blog is an idea that came from the bike.
- **Really think about software development not as a job that you do, but as a service that you provide for others.** Thus you want to provide a quality of software development that matches your preferred quality for the people you hire when you do things. You don't hire (and you certainly won't rehire) a carpenter who sucks, so why would others hire a developer who also sucks? This is our craft, we should at least care about it.
