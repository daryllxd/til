## Programming

- Don't use backticks when committing. `gc "Use 'hello'` will try to execute hello command. (if the ' was a backtick, it's hard to parse in jekyll)."
- API design, if you are going to add contacts with a bunch of emails or something, better to just fail all rather than pass the valid ones and report the fails, that way you can't add twice. Front-end will get errors one by one.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
