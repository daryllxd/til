- Apparently `active_model.errors.full_messages` exists, and is not something like `active_model.errors.map { |x| x.full_messages }`.
- `rescue` block implicitly `begins` in a method's scope. If you want to rescue while inside a method to rescue at any time inside a method, then just put `rescue`, no need to do `begin`.
- `each_with_object` is better than `inject` because of the chances to do bugs.
- You can use adapter classes to convert AR models to service class value objects.
- AR `merge` is about 10x faster than a `map` after the initial query is done [link](https://coderwall.com/p/9xk6ra/rails-filter-using-join-model-on-has_many-through).
- The `head, *tail` and `required_options, **optional_options` (hehe) is very useful!
- You can do this: `obj.methods.grep(/my/)` to check if methods exist.
- `ThisTypeOfWriting` is called Pascal case (I think I knew this before).
