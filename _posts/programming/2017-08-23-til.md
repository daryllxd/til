- Sort by multiple fields: [Reference](https://coderwall.com/p/xmip3w/ruby-sort_by-multiple-fields)

``` ruby
array.sort_by do |item|
  [item.a, item.b]
end
```

- Check intersection of two arrays; `arr1 & arr2` then do a `.empty?` after to see if they have elements similar to each other.
- `bin/setup` to run the setup script for Rails when you onboard another dev.
- The Golfcrow API client is awesome.
