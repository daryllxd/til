- `TestProf`. [Reference](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/testprof-a-good-doctor-for-slow-ruby-tests)
- Man tests are just so good. 94% of Ruby developers do tests so I would suggest doing tests always. :)
- Youtube Error is due to The Great Suspender: [Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/6h59hh/400_thats_an_error_on_every_youtube_page/?st=j6mdzp56&sh=fd52f36c)
- The `%20` is not relevant when doing a GET, you do things like this: `localhost:3000/api/v1/users/courses/search/?name=Blue+Hill`.
- Postgres, you can create indexes on expressions.
- `CITEXT` is case-insensitive text, a possible column type.
- The creating your own API to your own app so you can access things faster.
- `before_action`, the action must be right it will silently fail.
