# How to Build Your Product Team
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAgrVsDBBXA)

- Pillars
  - User centric. The voice and advocate for the users. User interviews, customer development, persona development. What do they want to be?
  - Business centric. They have a product vision to achieve business objectives.
  - Data-informed decision making. SQL + Analytics + A/B Testing.
    - Influence without authority: persuade others with data, analyses, and storytelling.
  - Technology literate. They should at least know what tech to leverage to best execute their vision.
  - Cross-functional influence without authority
  - Team lead: Prioritize, unblock, ship
- Good PM vs Bad PM
  - Bad: Spends time on internal matters.       Good: Spends time validating with customers.
  - Bad: "Product must be right".               Good: Balances getting it right vs getting it out.
  - Bad: Only thinks about high-level problems. Good: High-level thinking + attention to detail.
  - Bad: Throws specs over the wall.            Good: Communicates shared understanding across the team.
  - Bad: Focused on inputs/outputs.             Good: Focused on outcomes over outputs.
- Product Managers are not Project Managers
- Product Design Question
  - Test for precision questioning: Do they know how to dig deep? What are we going to solve?
  - Understanding the user. Trade-offs, etc.
  - Metrics for success.

# Thing I Saw on LinkedIn

- Yi-Wei: Create a repeatable process that has the potential to continuously drive growth.
  - Have to know and think of your work as a series of small, continuous experiments to determine if a desired outcome is achieved.
  - This has to be falsifiable!
  - The key for these experiments is learning.
  - Experimental backlog.
- TradeGecko example:
  - Growth of leads were not proportional to content output.
  - Hypothesis: "We believe that by providing free tools on existing content, we can get higher yields"
    - +Engagement, -Bounce rate, but no impact to leads
    - Clear CTA with a downloadable: increased leads generated on the page by 10x.
    - Data-driven experiments give you confidence to double down.
  - All components of product, engineering, marketing, and sales need to work in harmony to create a desirable customer journey.
