- Vim, visual block applies the next command to the block, and visual line doesn't.
- You can put `require` inside a method.
- No need to
- Whenever: `wheneverize`, `crontab -l`.
- Rails task: `rails g task namespace my_task1 my_task2` [Reference](https://railsguides.net/how-to-generate-rake-task/)
- Whenever: They start off with almost no environment variables.
- To remediate:

``` ruby
set :job_template, nil
set :output, 'cron.log' -> Just so you can see error messages
set :environment, 'development' -> By default this will be set as production
job_type :rake,"cd :path && :environment_variable=:environment bundle exec rake :task --silent :output" ->
env :PATH, ENV['PATH'] -> Add the normal ENV vars so you have Bundler accessible.
```

- `pg_dump and growl` to back up own database every 3 hours.
