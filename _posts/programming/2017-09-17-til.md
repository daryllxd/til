## Why is GitHub not used like Dropbox, for sharing video and audio?
[Reference](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/39019/why-is-github-not-used-like-dropbox-for-sharing-video-and-audio)

- Soft limit of 1GB.
- Github rejects pushes containing files larger than 100 MB.
- If a repo is 10 GB in size, Git's architecture requires another 10 GB of extra free space available at all times.
- Large SQL files do not play well with version control systems such as Git. If you are looking to provide your developers with the most recent production dataset, we recommend using Dropbox for sharing files like these among your developers.

- This (`#!`) is called a Shebang.
- `du -d 1 -h`: `-d 1` means depth 1. `-h` means human-readable.
- `cut` command.
