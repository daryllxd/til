- Works of highest quality: produced by the group being graded for quantity, not quality. The "quantity" people were churning out piles of work and learning from their mistakes, and the "quality" group theorized about perfection.

# What are HTTP and the HTTP Proxy?
[Reference](http://www.watchguard.com/training/fireware/82/httppro2.htm)

- There is an initial CONNECT handshake between the PROXY and the CLIENT.

# Letter on SOA

- Pager escalation gets harder, because a ticket might bounce through several calls before the real owner is identified.
- Other teams can become a DDOS attacker.
- Monitoring and QA - you have to actually call the other service.
- Universal service registry, which itself is another service.
- Amazon has transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion.
- Google is not that good in platforms, because they don't dog food. Google+. They tried to predict what people want and deliver it for them, and you can't do that, not really, and not reliably.
- Platforms are accessibility.
  - MS and `msdn.com` is staggeringly huge.
  - Amazon and AWS is huge.
  - Apple.
  - Facebook.
