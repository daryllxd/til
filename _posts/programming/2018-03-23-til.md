## Musings

- Normalization: Just do it until it hurts.
- Summary tables?
- Redis data structure costs: Hash is more efficient for objects.

- [Investigating Redis memory usage:](https://lethain.com/notes-on-redis-memory-usage/)
  - Sets are approximately 60% smaller than hashes or strings, but allow the same algorithmic complexity for lookup.
  - Sorted sets are about 60% larger than their unsorted counterparts which seems pretty reasonable considering the quantity of additional information being stored.

- `ruby-prof` dive:
  - You get to understand like how much time is actually spent in the methods.

- Stack vs heap:
  - Stack is for static memory allocation.
  - Heap is for dynamic memory allocation.
