- `cap puma:stop` and `cap puma:start`.
- Puma has its own sessions which need a `sudo reboot` to restart. Even restarting.
- You can write `def haha(*)` if you want to write a function that can accept arguments but not use them.
- Ruby struct can be initialized with less than the 'required' arguments. Something to think about.
- Think about: values library (`https://github.com/tcrayford/Values`).
- Access a method using `object.method(:one)`. Access its arity by `object.method(:one).arity`.
- `attr_extras` seems good, but no keyword arguments. So...
- When thinking about Struct vs Hash, think about reducing the number of nil checks that would probably appear. [Reference](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/05/25/sometimes-its-better-to-use-a-ruby-hash-than-create-a-custom-class/)
