- `countries` gem.
- `SecureRandom.random_number`.
- Thinking through how to implement my own version of Active Model Serializer or at least how it works.
- GraphQL: The main problem with APIs is the multiple endpoints and multiple round trips.
- I keep on forgetting freaking `Enumerable#each_with_object` but whatever.
- `ActionPack` is made of `ActionController` and `ActionDispatch`.
- Should I version every gem in the Gemfile?
- Update `codeclimate-test-reporter` to 1.0.5.
