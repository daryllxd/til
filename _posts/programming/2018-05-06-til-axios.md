# Musings, Rails

- Really weird naming for Rails constraints.
- Fixed `NameError: uninitialized constant Mime::HTML` in Rails logs.
  - Upgraded bootsnap in an attempt to fix the problem. (Did not work.) https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap/issues/123
  - Removed web-console for the mean time. https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/29408
