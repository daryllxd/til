- Rails `where`--optimistically finds, if can't, it will return an empty or will just return what it found, without an error.
- You can do `reload` with a lock?
- No implicit conversion of Symbol to Integer--just a missing hash key?
- No to polymorphic association--SQL Anti-pattern, since no freaking way to do the foreign key association.
- Creating a join table:
  - Add foreign key
  - Add index to both tables being joined
  - Add unique index
- `shared_examples`
- `Date.current.beginning_of_week`
- Railties--used to hook onto Rails.
- You can fiddle around the `request.variant` (`variant` is just a created attribute of `request` via `ActionPack`--subclass `ApplicationController` and check the `request.user_agent`. [Reference](https://richonrails.com/articles/action-pack-variants-in-rails-4-1)
