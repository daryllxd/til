- Android push notifications: Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).
- `public_send`: Only public methods.
- Tried `GraphQL`. It's awesome. Not sure if it is stable enough to be a future part of the stack, but in theory it works.
  - Able to set up in 20 minutes.
  - Hard to format in Vim.
- Need to get better at ES6?
