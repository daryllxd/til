# WebDev 101: How to use npm and Yarn
[Reference](https://unicorn-utterances.com/posts/how-to-use-npm)

- Node - allows you to run JS on your machine without running it in the browser.
  - You can write JS that interacts with your computer in ways your browser cannot, like host a REST web server, write files to the hard drive, interact with the OS.
  - Can interface with C APIs.
- `npm`
  - Registry - the servers and databases that host the packages with their specific named packages.
  - The CLI - runs on your computer to install and manage the packages on your local disk.
- `Yarn` - it does not host its own registry. If you install a library using `yarn`, you'll use the NPM registry and the `yarn` CLI tool.
- Using Node
  - `node index.js` to execute files.
  - `nodemon` is the library that listens to file changes and restarts the process whenever any of your dependencies change.
- Do not commit `node_modules`: It bloats the size of the repository, slows down the cloning of the project, makes it difficult/impossible to do analytics on the code, and removes the potential to install security updates with semver ranges.
- You do commit `package-lock.json`, so CI pipelines run the same versions of dependencies you're utilising on your local machine.
