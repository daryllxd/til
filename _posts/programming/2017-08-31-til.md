- Bunch of stuff on how joins actually work via StackOverflow.
- `SELECT... LEFT JOIN B ON A.Key = B.key WHERE B.Key is NULL`: Select only A that doesn't exist in B.
- `SELECT... OUTER JOIN B ON A.Key = B.key WHERE A.Key is NULL OR B.Key is NULL`.: Select stuff in A and stuff in B, but not stuff in A/B. Assuming key is unique.
