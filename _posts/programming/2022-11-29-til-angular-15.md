# Angular’s Future Without NgModules – Part 1: Lightweight Solutions Using Standalone Components

# Routing and Lazy Loading with Angular’s Standalone Components
[Reference](https://www.angulararchitects.io/aktuelles/routing-and-lazy-loading-with-standalone-components/)

- Why again? Because we needed a way to group building blocks that are used together - for devs and for the Angular compiler. This is so the Angular compiler knows which things are supposed to compile.
  - Community not happy, because it becomes another module system besides ECMAScript.
  - Ivy - The compiled application works without modules at runtime.
- With standalone components, it will be possible to bootstrap a single component via `bootstrapApplication`.
  - `importProvidersFrom` - allows bridging the gap to existing `NgModules`.

```
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule),
    provideRouter(APP_ROUTES,
      withPreloading(PreloadAllModules),
      withDebugTracing(),
    ),

    [...]

    importProvidersFrom(TicketsModule),
    provideAnimations(),
    importProvidersFrom(LayoutModule),
  ]
});
```

- You can lazily load a component directly:

```
    // Option 1: Lazy Loading another Routing Config
    {
        path: 'flight-booking',
        loadChildren: () =>
            import('./booking/flight-booking.routes')
                .then(m => m.FLIGHT_BOOKING_ROUTES)
    },

    // Option 2: Directly Lazy Loading a Standalone Component
    {
        path: 'next-flight',
        loadComponent: () =>
            import('./next-flight/next-flight.component')
                .then(m => m.NextFlightComponent)
    },
```

- Services for specific routes: With `NgModule`, each lazy module introduced a new injector and hence a new injection scope. To cover such cases, you can now add introducing providers for each route.

```
export const FLIGHT_BOOKING_ROUTES: Routes = [{
    path: '',
    component: FlightBookingComponent,
    providers: [
        provideBookingDomain(config)
    ],
```

- Technically, adding `providers` introduces a new injector at the level of the route. Such an injector is called Environment Injector and replaces the concept of the former `NgModule` injectors.
- NgRx: Can do `provideStore`, `provideEffects` now.

```
import { provideStore } from '@ngrx/store';
import { provideEffects } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { provideStoreDevtools } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';

import { reducer } from './app/+state';

[...]

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule),
    provideRouter(APP_ROUTES,
      withPreloading(PreloadAllModules),
      withDebugTracing(),
    ),

    // Setup NGRX:
    provideStore(reducer),
    provideEffects([]),
    provideStoreDevtools(),
```

- Can also have `provideState` and `provideEffects` in the respective routing configuration.
- `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER`: a function executed when the environment injector is initialized.

# Angular v15 is now available!

- Standalone APIs are out of the developer preview.
- Router and `HttpClient` are tree-shakeable standalone APIs.
- `provideRouter` is tree-shakeable (!).
- Directive composition: Adding directives to a host element via `hostDirectives`.
- Image directive is now stable - automatic `srcset` generation (`ngOptimizedImage`).
- Functional router guards.
- Router unwraps default imports.
- Auto-unwrapping the standalone component

```
{
  path: 'lazy',
  loadComponent: () => import('./lazy-file').then(m => m.LazyComponent),
}

to

{
  path: 'lazy',
  loadComponent: () => import('./lazy-file'),
}
```

- Refactoring Angular material components based on Material Design Components for Web.
- Moving some components to use design tokens and CSS variables under the hood.
- `esbuild`.
