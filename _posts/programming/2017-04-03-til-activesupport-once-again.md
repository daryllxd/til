- `spring`: Rails console is also included, you have to restart `spring` if you changed something in `config/initializers/`.
- `Date.to_formatted_s`, just put your own conversions in `config/initializers/`. Rails
- Keyword arguments: They are sort of slower than normal arguments?
- `benchmark-ips`.
