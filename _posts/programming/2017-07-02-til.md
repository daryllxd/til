- Bash: `set -e` to terminate the script when something goes wrong.
- Bash: `set -x` to print each command that is going to be executed with a little plus.
- Bash: `set -u`: Treats unset variables as an error and exit immediately.
- Bash: `set -v`: Prints shell input lines as they are read.

[Reference](https://askubuntu.com/questions/157779/how-to-determine-whether-a-process-is-running-or-not-and-make-use-it-to-make-a-c)
``` shell
pgrep -x ruby > /dev/null => pgrep to see if a process is running
                          => /dev/null: this redirects the command standard output to the null device, which is a special device which discards the information written to it
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then     => this is how loops are in bash
  killall -9 ruby         => the $? variable is "the exit code of the last command.
fi
```

- Only rescue `StandardError` at least.
- Fixing "Unresolved specs during Gem::Specification.reset:" `gem cleanup minitest` or whatever it was.
- Make sure integer strings and work: `Integer("25")`.
- Avoid rescue in the modifier form (`5 / 0 rescue nil`), just use the block form.
- `pry-nav` is for JRuby, `pry-byebug` is for MRI. They might conflict especially in 2.4.0.
- `default_scope`: Think about this again.
- `rspec spec` bases itself on the `db/schema`, not the migration.
