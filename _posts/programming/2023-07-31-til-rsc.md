# Server Components

- React gives you the flexibility to choose where to render your components based on their purpose.
- Why?
  - Data fetching is closer to the database.
  - Keep dependencies that could impact client JS bundle size on the server.
  - Initial page load should be faster as the client-side JS bundle size is reduced.
  - Additional JS is only added as client-side interactivity and is used in the app through Client components.
  - **All the components inside the App Router are Server Components by default, including special files and co-located components.**

## Client Components

- **Pre-rendered on the server, hydrated on the client.**
- Server components:
  - Fetch data
  - Access back-end resources
  - Keep API keys
  - Keep large dependencies
- Client components:
  - Add interactivity
  - Use State and Lifecycle Effects
  - Use browser-only APIs
  - Use custom hooks
  - Use React Class components
