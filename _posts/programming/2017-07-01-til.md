- `cp /daryllxd/docs/. /thoughts` to copy just the contents, not the folders.
- `time sleep 2` to get the time it takes to execute something. You can also put it in a loop.
- [Bootsnap](https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap): Super drop in solution, just plop it in and Rails startup becomes faster (for the daryllxd app, boot time had a 30% improvement).
- Watir: Need chrome driver.
- Add to load path in zsh: Need to modify the specific zsh thingie
- `magic_frozen_string_literal`: if true, then you don't need to do the `.freeze` for each string.
- `YAML.safe_load`: Same as `YAML.load`, but it only deserializes a bunch of classes: `TrueClass`, `FalseClass`, `NilClass`, `Numeric`, `String`, `Array`, `Hash`.
