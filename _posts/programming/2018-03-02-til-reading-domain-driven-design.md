## Musings

- Reading Domain-Driven Design. Actually I think I'm faster reading now because I don't read cover to cover anymore, I skim and figure out the things I need.
- I love having `memoist` and `db-query-matchers` as a part of my toolkit!
- Enumerable implementation.
- I was using the wrong terminology re: the internals of the app, it should be `Entities`, not `Values`.
- Hugo fix if you delete the themes directory (lol). `git submodule add --force https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/gohugo-theme-ananke`
- I really have to make my own Hugo theme, boys.
- `sort_by` into `reverse` works when you want to make sure you use block notation re: sort.
