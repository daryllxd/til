# Preparing for Promotions Ahead of Time
[Reference](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/preparing-for-promotions)

- Why? Perform at next level. Impact at the next level. Business need and business case. Raise the bar at next level.
- In practice: Perceived impact. Support from others. Internal politics.
- Heavyweight promotion process with the goal of reducing bias: usually has a paperwork-heavy process.
- Promotions at big tech:
  - Pay for performance.
  - How? Software engineering, design/architecture, execution/results, collaboration, creating efficiency.
- Promotion-driven development:
  - Unfortunate consequence of the impact-drive nature of promotions and performance reviews at Big Tech.
  - Engineers will typically write their own, in-house solution, and justify edge cases where existing solutions don't work well enough.
  - *There is little to no incentive for any engineer to go with an off-the-shelf vendor solution that solves the problem.* This is why there are 20 different chat products in Google.
