- `TestProf` seems like overkill at the start but it's a nice to have tool.
- Factory Doctor [Reference](https://github.com/palkan/test-prof/blob/master/guides/factory_doctor.md) is nice but now it gets me thinking on tests that save things to the database. Do we want to still hit disk every time?
- Still the thing that bothers me is the persistence part. How do you make sure that things are really saved though.
- `RSpecStamp` = a tool to automatically tag failed examples with custom tags.
- I guess I just use `let` if I need to check a `count`?
