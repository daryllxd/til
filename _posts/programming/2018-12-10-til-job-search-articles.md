# Lessons From A Silicon Valley Job Search
[Reference](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/07/lessons-from-a-silicon-valley-job-search/)

- Finding the right level of confidence between over- and under-.
- Some people and companies are better or worse at interviewing candidates than others.
- Some companies pay out for the interview.
- Be quietly confident: there are still not that many Rails apps makers and maintainers.
- OSS and active StackOverflow and cool blog.
- Always assume that "experience with any of our technologies is just a plus."
- Engineer crunch: There are lots of jobs for engineers but not enough people with skills to do them all.
- Cover letter will matter only to get you through the door. Do quirky things there.
- Where to look: HN Who's hiring, AngelList, LinkedIn, Hired.com, "Hire me" on the blog.
- Just make interviews even if you get annihilated.
- Standard questions:
  - Yourself
  - Next product/team/technical challenge
  - Scaling applications
  - Cool project worked on recently
- Algorithms, phone screen process, distributed systems
- Possible questions: Infrastructure for a link-shortener and what happens when you go to Google?
- Write about the interview.
- Find out next steps. Actually scheduling and/or doing phone interviews are really tiring.
- On-site: takes a really long time!
