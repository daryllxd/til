- Really 5head: [Reference](https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro-antd/pull/7185) as it looks like it's disattaching itself from Angular to do the input changes and then manually calls change detection.

```
new Observable<KeyboardEvent>(subscriber =>
  this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() =>
    fromEvent<KeyboardEvent>(textarea.nativeElement, 'keydown').subscribe(subscriber)
  )
)
```

- Lifecycle hooks to check Change Detection:
  - `ngDoCheck()`: Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own. See details and example in Defining custom change detection in this document. Called immediately after `ngOnChanges()` on every change detection run, and immediately after `ngOnInit()` on the first run.
- `vm$` will not retrigger on components who do not need the observable that changed, only if the component is `ChangeDetection.onPush`.

- Directive modifying the HTML host. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350403/angular2-directives-modifying-its-html-host)
