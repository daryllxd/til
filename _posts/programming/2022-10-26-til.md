# Meet PNPM: The Faster, More Performant NPM
[Reference](https://blog.bitsrc.io/pnpm-javascript-package-manager-4b5abd59dc9)

- PNPM: Hold all the packages at a global, centralized store and use them if needed by other projects too by creating hard links to it.
  - Saves disk space, faster to install packages, in-built support for mono-repos.
  - NPM: We can't reuse dependencies already installed for another project in NPM.
  - Content-addressable store is a storage mechanism where the data is stored on hard disk by assigning a permanent location, and addressing it with a unique identifier.
