- `SELECT date_trunc('day', pomodoros.created_at::DATE) AS date_created, SUM(pomodoros.duration) as total_duration FROM pomodoros GROUP BY date_created ORDER BY date_created DESC`
- `Pomodoro.connection.select_rows` to grab a hash or grab the rows, faster than `all`. [Reference](http://brettu.com/rails-daily-ruby-tip-41-grab-a-hash-vs-activerecord-objects/)
- `I18n` is not that hard, I think just the process of how you structure the yml will be the hard part.
