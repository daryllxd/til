- `config.middleware.delete 'ActiveRecord::QueryCache'`
- Saving phone numbers: Split across country code and phone number. Country code no plus. (According to Twilio convention.)
- `Array.uniq` includes a block that determines the uniqueness of elements.
- Returning boolean from the `JOIN` statement: You have to create a `FUNCTION`, or do a subquery. Well, Postgres needs the one to have that capability since you are in the SQL part already.
- Query counters: This is probably just needed in controller or big interactor tests.
- Link and link tables across to each other: Use the `has_many :x, source: :y` to jump through the associations. You can use another AR model's association to jump, as opposed to using an SQL join (well it would actually be the same thing anyway).
- `rails server --debugger` was used before, now it's not.
