- Ruby boolean to int: No easy way? Either you define `class TrueClass def to_i 1` etc.
- Reading Gitlab's base service.
  - `Allowable` module
  - `CurrentSettings` to retrieve app things from database or cache.
  - `NotificationService` as a component to send emails. Each possible email is in the `NotificationService`.
  - `EventCreateService` which creates an `Event` row in the database if an event is created.
  - `TodoService` which is like the same as `Event` but for `Todos`.
- `TodosFinder` does the thing where if something is passed add a `where` clause but if not just return the same thing. So you extract the actual querying logic into the finder.

``` ruby
def by_type(items)
  if type?
    items = items.where(target_type: type)
  end

  items
end
```
