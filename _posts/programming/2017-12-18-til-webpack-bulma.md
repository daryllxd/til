- Github shows potential security vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
- `active_interaction` [Reference](https://github.com/AaronLasseigne/active_interaction) looks nice.
- You can update multiple gems with `bundle update rspec rspec-rails`.
- Just use Devise rather than clearance since you're used to it already.
- Example of a `frontendlibrary-rails`: [Reference](https://github.com/joshuajansen/bulma-rails)
- The `web-console` I have (2.x) is so old, I should use the 3.x one.
- `Bulma` CSS framework (flexbox-based) is just CSS, no JS.
- `rails -t` to run tests!
- `rails -T` to see commands.
- `webpacker`: now you have two servers, `rails s` and `webpack-dev-server`, which you can use `Foreman` so you can do live code reload.
- `javascript_pack_tag` and `stylesheet_pack_tag`.
- `yarn install bulma` to easily install new things.
- `config/webpacker.yml` contains the things.
- Bulma has just CSS, no JS. Which is good but also bad if I just want to ship things.
- Flexbox sticky footer: [Reference](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/)
