- Asset Prefix: By offloading static assets to distributed servers, they can access your website from servers closer to their location.
- When deploying to Vercel, a global CDN is automatically configured. For other deployment, add asset prefix.
- Base path
- Compression: By default, will have

```
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
};
```

- Custom build directory
- Env variables.
- Etags for caching (by default, has).
- Custom HTTP headers - `headers()` - ex: `X-Frame-Options`.
- HTTP Keep-Alive.
- Image loader (`images`).
- Incremental handler: By default, we use the filesystem cache for data fetching and caching. You can have a different cache handler path though.
- `x-powered-by` header.
- Redirects and rewrites - array of objects that contains `source`, `destination`, and `permanent` properties.
