- Trying out `Nx` for real:
  - We can have individual theme files for each of the projects: [Reference](https://github.com/daryllxd/angular-generals/pull/1/commits/ee9a04250cd5e7fcd09fa0df583a0ac154bc2c5c)
- Specify Node version: [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60051990/set-node-version-differently-for-specific-projectfolder-via-nvm)
  - Use an `.nvmrc` file in the root and use `nvm use VERSION` to use it.
