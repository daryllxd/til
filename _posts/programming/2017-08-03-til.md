- Rails `find_by` works if finding by a model but I pass an ID in?
- Non-breaking space.
- `select * from pg_timezone_names`.
- ALIAS in a WHERE clause, not standard (works in MySQL but not in PostgreSQL?)
- Timezone 3 or 4 letter codes--these are different from place to place (EST or EDT), use the names (`America/New_York`). A time zone is more than an offset; a time zone includes the past, present, and future set of rules and anomalies such as DST.
- Postgres Timestamps--if you want to qualify by date, you need to tell Postgres to treat the date field as a Timestamp first (`.where('pomodoros.created_at::timestamp WITH TIME ZONE AT TIME ZONE '#{Pomodoros::Constants::TIMEZONE_BASIS}'"`).
