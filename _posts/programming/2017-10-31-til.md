- Git submodules: allow you to include or embed one or more repositories as a sub-folder inside another repository.
  - `git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/rock rock` to add the repo to the `rock` subfolder.
  - On Github, there will be the icon which shows it is a submodule.
  - When you join a project with submodules, if you check in the `rock` folder, you'd see nothing. You have to do `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Or you can clone with a `--recursive` flag (`git clone --recursive <project url>`).
  - Really think about submodules, maybe there is a better alternative available.
- Git submodules or subtrees? Not really sure hehe.
- The initial Hugo deploy is way hard. But what I did was I just made the dev branch the main one which spits out to the master branch. Hehe.
- Really forgot how long it takes the DNS to propagate when creating a new subdomain, lol.
- Hugo is on `localhost:1313`.
