- `ActiveRecord::EachValidator`, how to write it.
- Apparently there is an `options` field there?
- Confirming: Rails `find` method: find, if many, return all, if unable to find all, raise `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`.
- `Select. From` in Rails.
- Namespacing: If the namespace verb already exists in the current namespace, that's when you do the `::` before.
- `paranoia` or `acts_as_paranoid` for soft delete: this would work only if you need the parent when calling from the orphan.
- `Rails.root`.
- Twilio has a lookup API.
- AR is peppered with `RangeError`--raised when a numerical value is out of range.
- Daemonize `Redis`: `redis-server &`.
- Redis sentinel: High availability for Redis. Using Sentinel, you can create a Redis deployment that resists without human intervention to certain kinds of failures.
  - Distributed system: Acts as authority for clients service: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the current Redis master responsible for a given service.
