# Building Dockerfiles

```
FROM node:12-stretch

CMD ["node", "-e", "console.log(\"hi lol\")"]
```

- Start with the `node` container. This comes from at least at some point, a Debian image.
- There is only one `CMD` instruction.
- `docker build . --tag my-node-app`
- `docker run my-node-app`
- `docker images` - show the images you built
- You can version them if you want to
- `docker ps` - see all running Docker processes
- `docker stop ${PID}` - well, stop it
- Can't stop with `CTRL+C`, you have to handle it yourself in the Node.js code, or you can tell Docker to handle it with `init` flag.
- `docker run --init --publish 8000:3000 my-node-app # or you can use -p instead of --publish`
  - Run the app that we have in the container (port 3000) and expose it to port 8000 (localhost:8000 locally)

```
FROM node:12-stretch

USER node

COPY index.js /home/node/code/index.js // Copy current index.js to that directory in the container

CMD ["node", "/home/node/code/index.js"]
```

- `USER` instruction let's us switch from being the root user to different user. The NODE user was already created by the image need to run `useradd` to add another user.
- `WORKDIR` - changing directory.

- EXPOSE ???

# React-query: Parallel and Dependent Queries
[Reference](https://ui.dev/c/react-query/parallel-and-dependent-queries)

- Getting both repos and gists: `Promise.all`

```
function getReposAndGists(username) {
  return Promise.all([
    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`)
      .then((res) => res.json()),
    fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/gists`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
  ]);
}
```

- `useQueries` - used to fetch a variable number of queries.
- Dependent query: Use `useQuery` third parameter - the configuration object.

Run the `issuesQuery` only after the labels query has been fetched.
```
const labelsQuery = useQuery(
  ["repos", owner, repo, "labels"],
  () => fetch(
    `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/labels`
  ).then((res) => res.json())
);

const labels = labelsQuery.data

const issuesQuery = useQuery(
  ["repos", owner, repo, "issues"],
  () => fetch(
    `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues?labels=${labels[0].name}`
  ).then((res) => res.json()),
  {
    enabled: !!labels
  }
);

```

- `fetch Status` - if it's `fetching`, `idle`, or `paused`.
- Deferred query: Something like when the query immediately makes a request with an empty search query.
- `encodeURIComponent()`

# useQuery API Reference
[Reference](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery?from=reactQueryV3&original=https%3A%2F%2Ftanstack.com%2Fquery%2Fv3%2Fdocs%2Freference%2FuseQuery#_top)

- `querykey` - query will update when the key changes, as long as `enabled` is not set to false.
- `queryFn` - required, but only if no default query function has been defined.
- `enabled` - disable to stop the query from automatically running, used for dependent queries.
