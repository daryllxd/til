- [Reaction to Chamath](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7j31he/former_facebook_exec_i_think_we_have_created/)
  - When people scroll down, they pick the first comment that sounds good for them, and adopt that as their own opinion. People are unable to think for themselves.
  - Just say "I don't know" if you don't know things. Not having an opinion about something is okay.
  - Karma in Reddit plays a role in how conversations are ordered and shown.S
  - Reddit vs Facebook: access to communities that share my interests via subreddits. Facebook: gratification, not community building. Ex: beekeeping is not a popular interest, but Reddit makes it possible to create a decently sized community.
  - Facebook is worse than Reddit, because it consisted of friends, rather than strangers.
  - Things that are consumer driven are short term in nature today.
  - Like all tech, social media comes with both challenges and potential benefits.
