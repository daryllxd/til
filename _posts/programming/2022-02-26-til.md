# How to Stop Worrying and Start Living

- Law of averages.
- Being blind - "How wonderful, that science now has the skill to operate on anything so delicate as the human eye!"

```
For every ailment, under the sun.
There is a remedy, or there is none;
If there be one, try to find it;
If there be none, never mind it.
```

- Socrates: "Try to bear lightly what needs must be."
- Marcus Aurelius: "Our life is what our thoughts make it."
- Concerned - realizing what the problems are, and calmly taking steps to meet them. Worrying - means going around in maddening, futile circles.
- The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of Hell, a hell of Heaven.
- "A man is not so hurt as much by what happens, as by his opinion of what happens. And our opinion of what happens is entirely up to us."

## The High Cost of Getting Even

- If selfish people try to take advantage of you, cross them off your list, but don't try to get even. When you try to get even, you hurt yourself more than you hurt the other fellow?
  - The chief personality characteristic of people with hypertension is resentment.
- "Thank God that life has not made us what they are. Instead of heaping condemnation and revenge upon our enemies, let's give them our understanding, our sympathy, our help, our forgiveness, and our prayers."

- It's natural for people to forget to be grateful; so if we go around expecting gratitude, we are headed straight for a lot of heartaches.
- If we want to find happiness, let's stop thinking about gratitude or ingratitude and give for the inner joy of giving.
- "I had the blues because I had no shoes, until upon the street; I met a man who had no feet."
- About 90% of the things in our life are right and about 10% are wrong. If we want to be happy, we have to be concentrate on the 90%.
- The habit of looking on the best side of every event is worth more than a thousand pounds a year.

- "Two men looked out from prison bars, one saw the mud, the other saw stars." Changing attitudes or minds are able to change a wretched experience into the most exciting adventure of my life."
- The best things are the most difficult.
- Suppose we are so discouraged that we feel there is no hope of our ever being able to turn our lemons into lemonade, here are two reasons why we have everything to gain and nothing to lose:
  - We may succeed.
  - Even if we don't succeed, the mere attempt to turn our minus into a plus will cause us to look forward instead of backward; it will replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts; it will release creative energy and spur us to get so busy that we won't have either the time or the inclination to mourn over what is past and forever gone.

## What Life Should Meant to You

- Doing a good deed every day - bringing a smile of joy to the face of another.
- Carl Jung - "About one-third of my patients are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but  from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives."
- Doing good to others is not a duty. It is a joy, for it increases your own health and happiness. "When you are good to others, you are best to yourself."
- "I never go into a hotel or a barber shop or a store without saying something agreeable to everyone I meet. I try to say something that treats them as an individual, not merely a cog in a machine."
- What people want is a little attention as human beings. When I meet a man on the street with a beautiful dog, I always comment on the dog's beauty.
- "A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives you roses."
- "Since I was a good listener and encouraged the boys to talk about themselves, I gave them happiness and I gradually became the most popular girl in our social group."
