# React Query Course
[Reference](https://ui.dev/c/react-query/why-react-query)

- Client State
  - Ephemeral/goes away when the browser is closed.
  - Synchronous - instantly available.
  - Client-owned - stays local to the browser that created it.
- Server state - persistently stored on the server and sent to the browser when they visit the page.
- Data fetching:
  - React is quite unopinionated when it comes to `async` operations - they happen in a `useEffect` hook, and the most common asynchronous operation in a browser is a network request.
- How a normal network call slowly morphs into spaghetti:
  - Adding a "loading state"
  - Adding an "if response !== 200"
  - Fetching every time the user clicks the number - use `useReducer`.

## Typical Fetching Requirements

- Rendering the same data across multiple components without doing re-fetches
- De-duplicating identical requests
- Cache to limit the number of fetch requests
- Automatic refetching to have the freshest data
- Handling pagination
- Updating the local data when we make mutations
- Orchestrating requests that depend on the result of other requests

## How React Query Solves Server State

```
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

const fetchNumber = () => {
  return fetch("https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=100&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new")
    .then((response) => {
      if (response.status !== 200) {
        throw new Error(`Something went wrong. Try again.`);
      }

      return response.text();
    })
}

export const Random = () => {
  const query = useQuery(
    ["random"],
    fetchNumber,
  );

  if (query.isError) return <p>{query.error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <button onClick={() => query.refetch()}>
      Random number: {
        query.isLoading || query.isFetching ? "..." :
         query.data
      }
    </button>
  );
};
```

## The Query Client

- `QueryClient` and `useQuery` hook to perform the data fetch, caching, and provide us the state of the query.
- `useQuery` accepts two arguments, a query key and a query function.

Most basic:

```
const issuesQuery = useQuery(["issues"], () =>
  fetch("/api/issues").then((res) => res.json())
);
```

## Query keys and query functions

- Need a query key to identify the query, and a function to make the data request.
- Patterns:
  - Generic to specific
  - Duplicate query keys - if two queries with the same key have different data, that's bad.
- Tracking query dependencies - most query keys will use strings and numbers, but Objects are also useful.
- You can use objects as query keys if you have to store something like filter state.
- **Any function that returns a promise is a valid query function.**

### Using location as a promise

```
async function getLocation() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator
      .geolocation
      .getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
  });
}
```

```
function Location() {
  const locationQuery = useQuery(["location"], getLocation);

  if (locationQuery.isLoading) {
    return <p>Calculating location...</p>;
  }

  if (locationQuery.error) {
    return <p>Error: {userQuery.error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <p>
      Your location is:
      {locationQuery.data.coords.latitude},
      {locationQuery.data.coords.longitude}
    </p>
  );
}
```

- Query key values


```
async function getGithubUser({ queryKey }) {
  const [user, username] = queryKey;

  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`)
    .then((res) => res.json());
};

const User = ({ username }) => {
  const userQuery = useQuery(
    ["user", username],
    getGithubUser,
  );
```
