## Musings

- Watched [Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) again. I agree with everything, but I prefer using an object over a hash. What if I need methods on the object at some point? Also primitive obsession.
- I do believe in making things simple. As little code as possible (but also take into consideration future expansion).
- Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns: Execute Around Method, Debug Printing Method, Method Comment, Intention Revealing Messages.
- Vim not using zsh shell: `:set shell=zsh\ -l` [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22055613/zshell-aliases-like-gst-inside-vim)
