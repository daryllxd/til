- You can do this syntax: `<tr *ngFor="let lesson of (lessons$ | async)">....</tr>`.
- `this.userService.user$.subscribe(user => this.firstName = user.firstName );` => this one doesn't work with change detection.
- `this.firstName$ = this.userService.user$.map(user =>  user.firstName );` => this one works with change detection.
