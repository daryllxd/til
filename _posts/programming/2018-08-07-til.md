# When to use `freeze` and `frozen?` in Ruby
[Reference](http://blog.honeybadger.io/when-to-use-freeze-and-frozen-in-ruby/)

- Creating immutable constants: in Ruby, by default, constants are immutable, when you freeze the constant, then it really is actually constant.
- Reducing object allocations: `log('foobar')` creates a new String object. `log('foobar'.freeze)` caches the String for future use. Example: Rails router. It has `freeze` everywhere.
- Ruby 2.2: automatically freezes string literals that are used as hash keys.
- Ruby 3: all string literals will be frozen automatically in Ruby 3.
- You can call `freeze` in a constructor just to make sure that the object will never change.

```
class Point
  attr_accessor :x, :y
  def initialize(x, y)
    @x = x
    @y = y
    freeze
  end

  def change
    @x = 3
  end
end

point = Point.new(1,2)
point.change # RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Point
```

- `AppSetting.pluck("DISTINCT account_id")`
