- Review Singleton.
- You can `extend self`?
- Builder pattern to fix long parameter list.
- `memoist` DSL needs to be after the methods have been defined. Not sure how I feel about that.
- `alias` doesn't have a comma after the arguments. Wut.
- If you symlink a command, it will use the Ruby in the system, not the Ruby in the Gemfile of the directory of the command? Hmm. [Reference](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/405)
- `RUBY_VERSION` in irb/pry to get Ruby version being used.
