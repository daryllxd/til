- Sometimes the associations are also cached (RSpec things).
- Youtube downloader is surprisingly not that hard. Lots of options.
- nohup
  - Invokes a utility immune to hangups, whatever that means.
  - nohup sh -c "youtube-dl -o '~/Downloads/trainer/watch/%(title)s' $1 && say 'download finished' &" > ~/Downloads/trainer/watch/nohup.out
