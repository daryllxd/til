## Musings

- Vim slowness? This thing was actually killing me. Vim didn't have the usual snappiness.
  - Removed relative number.
  - Syntax highlighting possibly making it slow?
  - No. [It was freaking `set re=1`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25276429/848915). Wow. Thank you sir for being a life saver.
  - `:syntime on` and `:syntime report`

## Programming Elixir

- `$ mix ecto.dump` to dump db? You can also change the `ecto.migrate` task to dump the database as well.
- Rails way of getting everything out: `HabitsTwo.Repo.all(HabitsTwo.Auth.User)`.
- `iex.ex` file in the root of the app so you don't keep on aliasing shit.

``` elixir
# I can do Repo.all(Habit) to get all the habitz.

alias HabitsTwo.{ Repo, Habit }
alias HabitsTwo.Auth.User
```
