## Senior devs, what do you do on a daily basis?
[Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7nboax/senior_devs_what_do_you_do_on_a_daily_basis/)

- When reviewing code from juniors, I try to think of ways I can get them on the correct path.
- Hobbies in physically crafting things.
- Thinking up my own designs and coding are probably 3 to 4 hours a day. Also included in that time is working with product devs to see their schedules of when work will be completed so I don't try to automate testing of something that's about to majorly change.
- Morning and evening routine these days mostly revolve around my wife and 9 month old son. No extracurricular CS for me, which is relaxing. It's nice to be done with work at the end of the day.
- During work hours it varies by season, these days I'm mostly writing design docs for 2018's projects. During coding intensive periods I'll write max about 6 hours of code during work hours. Outside of work hours I try and do at least one Haskell exercise a day ~40 minutes.
- Chess is great for exercising the ability to imagine a situation that could exist and evaluating its pros and cons without committing to it. Reading fiction is also crucial for maintaining the ability to imagine things that do not exist -- this is useful when looking to solve problems for which solutions do not readily exist.
- I work on projects on my house and help at my church. Find non-coding hobbies that force either problem solving or communication. Both of those types of hobbies will help with your career without giving you a case of burnout from coding day in and out.
