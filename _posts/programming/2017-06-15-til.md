- `pkill Chrome` to kill Chrome immediately.
- You can't kill a tab individually though, since the process represents a renderer that the main browser uses to execute and draw a page, which it then copies to the screen. The "aw, Snap!" is what the browser displays when the renderer responsible crashes or gets killed.  [Reference](https://superuser.com/questions/306714/how-to-kill-one-tab-of-google-chrome-using-pid)
- `find` From man pages: recursively descends the directory tree for each path listed, evaluating an expression in terms of each file in the tree.
- `su`: Substitute user identity. Requests appropriate user credentials and switches to that user.
- `sudo su`: Run `su` as `sudo` which means as root. [Reference](https://askubuntu.com/questions/620936/difference-between-su-and-sudo-su)
- `sudo` determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file `/private/etc/sudoers`.
- When OS X means `/var/log`, it literally means `cd /var/log`.
