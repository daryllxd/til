- `Integer(hehe) rescue false` to ensure if string is an integer.
- `ctime`: Created time of a file.
- Thor mapping a command: `map 'n' => :new`
- `Dir.glob` returns filenames over the pattern supplied. This is how you get filenames.

## Ruby Shell commands
[Reference](http://tech.natemurray.com/2007/03/ruby-shell-commands.html)

- Ruby `system` creates a subprocess, `exec` replaces the current process.
- Backticks run a system command in a subshell and return the standard output from that command.
- `$?` is a `Process::Status` object.
- You can run a non-Ruby command in the shell using a script, and the standard output for that command

``` ruby
> `Date`
> $? => Process::Status object
> $?.to_i => exit code
> $?.pid
```
