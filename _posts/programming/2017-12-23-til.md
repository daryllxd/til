- `webpack --h | more`: Pipe to `more` to see command outputs in pages.

## What are NPM, Yarn, Babel, and Webpack; and how to properly use them?
[Reference](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/what-are-npm-yarn-babel-and-webpack-and-how-to-properly-use-them-d835a758f987)

- NPM: Package manager for Node based environments. The external dependencies get stored in a file called `package.json`.
  - `npm init` to create that initial file.
- Yarn: A package managed that uses the NPM registry as its backend, but it creates a `yarn.lock` file to store the exact versions of dependencies to the last digit. Yarn creates and updates this lock file when things get installed, NPM needs to do `shrinkwrap` function. Also, Yarn is faster.
- Babel: ES6 makes JS great again. Babel is a JS transpiler that converts new JS code into old ones.
- Webpack: To use SASS for styles, `PostCSS` for auto-prefixing, minification of code, we can use Webpack.
  - Loaders: transform the source code of a module.
  - Plugins: Does the things taht loaders can't.

- So you add using yarn.
- You differentiate between not having the loader and not finding the file in `webpacker`.
- The Vue thing is bad when you use the generator from `webpacker`.
- `form_with` exists?
