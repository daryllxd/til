summary: "BehaviorSubject"
---

- Minor ng-container things:
  - Cannot have `ngIf` and `ngTemplateOutlet` in at the same time.
  - Must be `div` with an `ng-container` inside, not vice-versa. `div` with `ngTemplateOutlet` will remove the `div`.
- `BehaviorSubject` - basically a subject that can have a value.
- `StripeElements` cannot have a value associated with them.
