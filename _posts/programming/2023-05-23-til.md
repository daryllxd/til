# Rendering
[Reference](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering)

- Pre-rendering: Fetching of external data and transformation of React components into HTML before the result is sent to the client.
  - By default, NextJS pre-renders every page.
- Client-side rendering - when the initial rendering work happens on the user's device.
- Server-side rendering: The HTML of the page is generated on the server for **each** request.
  - On the client, the HTML is used to show a **non-interactive** page, then react uses the JSON and JS instructions to make components interactive (such as attaching event handlers to a button) - hydration.
  - `getServerSideProps`.
- Static site generation: There is no server at runtime, instead, content is generated once, at build time, when the application is deployed, and the HTML is stored in a CDN.

## Static and Dynamic Rendering
[Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering)

- For a route to be statically rendered, the data requests are cached and there are not dynamic functions.
- Dynamic data fetching - makes Next render the whole route dynamically, at request time.
- By default, Next will cache the result of `fetch()` requests that do not specifically opt out of caching behavior.
