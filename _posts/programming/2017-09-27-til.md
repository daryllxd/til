- `have_http_status ok` is only for controller specs, not for general HTTP responses.
- [Reference](http://www.matijs.net/blog/2016/04/10/private-toolbox-an-anti-pattern)Private toolbox (superclass with many methods as opposed to mixins):
  - Not clear at the point of method definition what a method's purpose is.
  - Extra private methods that neither it not its subclasses actually use.
  - Superclass interface is extended to its non-public methods.
  - New subclasses may need to share methods that are not available in the superclass.
- With mixins, the name of the mixin describes the behavior that is added, private methods can be changed, and if a new implementation of a mixin is needed, nothing needs to be changed.
- Mixins would make things similar to the strategy pattern.
- `Rolify` is simple enough.
- `Mechanize` doesn't have JS.
