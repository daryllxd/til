- A freaking weird bug on a finder method.
- Refactored a lot today. Getting the hang of OOP with the AsciiTable printer class. I can add a Json printer tomorrow.
- Writing a better error message: you can overload and override an `Error`'s constructor, but pass the message directly because `Error#message` will return a string (hashes or arrays become ugly).

      class Errors::ObjectNotFoundError < StandardError
        def initialize(finder_class, param_hash_location)
          super("Cannot find `#{finder_class.to_s.tableize.singularize}` in `#{param_hash_location}` with that id.")
        end
      end

- Clarifies what `require: false` in a Gemfile means.
- Spent a few hours studying Rubocop.
- `spec_helper` apparently has a `profile_examples`.
- Whatever `Missing frozen_style literal` is.
- `%i()` to create an array of symbols `%i(first_name last_name).
- Creating methods to ensure that params lists are correct.
- Browsing [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals).
- Fixed my sed issue by using `gnu-sed`.
