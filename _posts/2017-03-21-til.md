- `ag`: You can do `ag boolean db/migrate`, the formula is `ag PATTERN PATH`.
- Boolean columns in Rails have the predicate method available already: `User.email_confirmed?`.
- Controller actions -- Use `before_action` to ensure you can render out from another method.
- `icomoon` and defining custom icon fonts in Bootstrap.
- `stateful_enum` gem.
