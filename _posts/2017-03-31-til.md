- `Array.fill` is destructive (why not just have `Array.fill!` again?).
- `Array.take` returns an empty array if the array is empty. `Array.first` returns nil if the array is empty. [Reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16555206/arrays-in-ruby-take-vs-limit-vs-first)
- I think I can use `Array.transpose`, `Array.sample`, and `Array.permutation`. (I must have reimplemented them at some point when I could just have looked at the source.) [Reference](http://callahan.io/blog/2014/07/17/five-useful-ruby-array-methods/)
- Breaking up longs strings to multiple lines. [Reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10522414/breaking-up-long-strings-on-multiple-lines-in-ruby-without-stripping-newlines)

``` ruby
string = "line #1"\
         "line #2"\
         "line #3"

p string # => "line #1line #2line #3"
```

- Just to clarify: `a ||= b means a = b when a == false (falsey).`
- `Nokogiri` apparently needs other things like `libxml2`.
- Meta TIL: To add rouge actual CSS to this freaking blog, I followed the instructions [here](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/issues/343). We have Monokai now!
