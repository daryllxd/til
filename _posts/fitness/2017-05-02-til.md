## Conversations with Mayen and Wilfred

- Carbs only around the workout times.
- Push pull exercises.
- Mind-muscle connection.
- I think I like circuit workouts better, they are efficient in the use of time.
- My thighs are hard AF.

New sched

- Wake up around 9-10. Cardio 20-40 minutes (run 20m, HIIT bike 20m).
- Eat directly after. Oatmeal + 1x Bodhi + Olive oil.
- If hungry, eat an egg or tofu, drink milk.
