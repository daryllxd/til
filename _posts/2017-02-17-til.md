## Programming

- Don't use backticks when committing. `gc "Use 'hello'` will try to execute hello command. (if the ' was a backtick, it's hard to parse in jekyll)."
- API design, if you are going to add contacts with a bunch of emails or something, better to just fail all rather than pass the valid ones and report the fails, that way you can't add twice. Front-end will get errors one by one.
- `which rake` to figure out where the version of rake is coming from, at least you will prevent the `using bundle exec will help` error message. Or better yet just use `bundle exec` when in the context of a rails project to ensure that the Gemfile gem is the one being used rather than the system one.
- This will work: `User.where(User.arel_table[:email].not_eq(nil))`, better to read and you will clarify that the email field is coming from the users table (just in case you join this at some point).
