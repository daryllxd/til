- Remember `array.include?(element)` to check if an array includes an element.
- When checking if a key exists, do `hash.key?(key)`, not `hash[key]` because if `key` is `nil`, this will not populate the return.
- Updating stuff--be more stringent than normal, all params must be correct before an update is allowed. All params meaning that the params' keys should all be  editable attributes.
- Don't be shy to create new errors, they are all catchable in the controller, anyway.
- Not sure if `%i{key1 key2}` is something I like yet.
