- Apparently, `rails-erd` bases its diagram off the models, not what a migration does, or what `db/schema.rb` looks like.
- Confusion in AR relationships: If the table you are using HAS the foreign key, use `has_one`. If the other table has the foreign key, use `belong_to`.
- A `question belongs_to :correct_answer, class_name: Answer` so you can do `question.correct_answer` (no need to add the `has_many` for the correct answer since you don't need it yet).
- Rethinking RSpec for service classes: You can use `described_class.new(params)`, then wrap it around a `let` block. [Example](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/spec/services/discussions/resolve_service_spec.rb).  (The Gitlab source code is very good for reviewing/"midnight reading".)
- AR relationships: Don't forget the `validates_presence_of` for `belongs_to` associations.
- `sed` for quotation marks ():  `find . -type f -exec gsed -i '' -e 's/require '"'"'rails_helper'"'"'/wutdufuk/g' {} +`
- I still sort of suck in the shell. I need to be better at shell commands.
- I really want to build a Rails generator for service objects, since I'm doing it consistently anyway.
- So when you do a `validates_uniqueness_of`, [you need to add an index to prevent the race condition)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34424154/rails-validate-uniqueness-of-two-columns-together).
